I make backrooms things if you want to look of what i have done well you can see my [Projects](https://backrooms.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Habitable/)
So far so good and i wasn't giving up yet and it looks like what i have done was well, You can see what i've done yourself.

Now when entering my page dont edit it with gibbresh. There is some rules on the Backrooms Wiki that you must follow because if not all the changes 
Will be reverted and your account would be blocked, Attempting to make an alt account will result a permanent ban on your main and alt and you could not use ALT's anymore after you get blocked permanently. So please follow rules!

If you want to make a new page in the WIKI then follow the tutorials. I would recommend you to watch this video that i linked here and it might help you! I hope you enjoy the video!
